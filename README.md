# ProjectSetupTool

How to use:
The Tool is super easy to use, just give it a path to the folder you want the project to get setup in.
Then you can give it a name, and a name prefix. The prefix can be up to 4 letters.
Then you can just select any addons you might want.

Project Types are as follows:
Normal UE4 Project - Standard setup with source folder
Empty UE4 Project - Nothing but the content and plugins folder and a .uproject file
Code Project - Same folder structure as a Normal UE4 Project, just without the build, target, and uproject files.

You can edit the base files located at ..\ProjectSetupTool\SetupFiles

How To Download:
You can either pull the source code and run it from Visual Studios OR you can just download the .exe and needed files.
