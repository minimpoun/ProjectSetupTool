# ProjectSetupTool

How to use:
The Tool is super easy to use, just give it a path to the folder you want the project to get setup in.
Then you can give it a name, and a name prefix. The prefix can be up to 4 letters.
Then you can just select any addons you might want.

Project Types are as follows:
Normal UE4 Project - Standard setup with source folder
Empty UE4 Project - Nothing but the content and plugins folder and a .uproject file
Code Project - Same folder structure as a Normal UE4 Project, just without the build, target, and uproject files.

You can edit the base files located at ..\ProjectSetupTool\SetupFiles


How To Download:
You can either pull the source code from the Master Branch and run it from Visual Studios OR you can just download the .exe and needed files from the Project Branch (recommended).
